const separator = document.createElement('hr'); //we make a spearator (which is unnecessary here, but it does help me differentiate between the two html files)
document.body.appendChild(separator); //we append it to the body
const table = new Table('table'); //we use the class to make a div with the 'table' class
const form = new Area('form'); //we make a div with the 'form' class
